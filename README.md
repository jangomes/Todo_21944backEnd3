Assignment Description
Create a new full stack web application using Python, Flask and MongoDB that can perform CRUD operations, Follow the on-line tutorial in the link below to create a template App.  Do the following tasks to extend the App:
Extend the App to use a new feature for the ToDo App and/or Use a new Data object for the App
Extend the App by adding a unit test to test the data entry form(s)
Optional for higher grade:  Extend the App to add login authentication.

## Testing of the function

A set of manual tests were performed on the website to ensure its functionality and responsiveness. The tests were designed to cover all commands and features of the site, including creating, updating, and deleting tasks, changing task importance, and marking tasks as completed. These tests were executed to verify that the site is working as expected and that all commands are responding correctly. By performing these manual tests, we were able to identify and resolve any issues, ensuring that the website is delivering the intended user experience.

- [X] - Marking a task as complete and verifying that the task displays correctly in the list of completed tasks.
- [X] - Deleting an existing task and verifying that the task is correctly removed from the todo list.
- [X] - Verification that the number of todos in the list is updated correctly when a new task is added or a task is deleted.

## Extended Features

The extended feature added to the code is a route that allows a user to update a specific task in the database.
This feature allows users to update their Todo list items by clicking on an "update" button. When they click the button, a pre-filled form appears with the current details of the Todo item. The user can then edit the details as needed and submit the form. The updated information is then saved to the database and the user is redirected back to the home page. Additionally, this feature includes a field to indicate whether or not the task is completed. If the user marks the task as completed, the database is updated accordingly.
